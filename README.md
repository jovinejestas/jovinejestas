 a young Tanzanian Software and 
Telecom Engineer .Currently In 
Tanzania working on Personal
and organisation's projects.

- 👨‍💻👨‍💻👨‍💻👨‍💻👨‍💻I’m deeply interested in General Idea of computerized
And programmable stuffz. This is to say, How can we manipulate a
Computer system to perform a reliable system. 
This goes from understanding the core concepts of 
Computer's binary computation system to the network transportation layers of the
Computed system all the way to the languages and their way of working
In interpreters or compilers and frameworks and modules that are all just to click that button on 
A computer system to submit this github post.👨‍💻👨‍💻👨‍💻👨‍💻

- 💻💻💻 I’m currently learning on how to secure my 
Node systems , as to be concerned ...We tend to use 
Alot of external codes in there.... And That's bothering
and yet disturbing fact.

-  I’m looking to collaborate on Node , JavaScript , API's (Rest, graphql) , Mobile Apps in React Native or expo
REACT Sql and non sql systems.
